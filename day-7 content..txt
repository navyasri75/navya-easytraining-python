##LAMBDA FUNCTION:

lambda functon its called as anonymous function when we want to use function concept alone
 without using function name there we apply concept of lamda function.

PROGRAM:
After creating a list with even numbers with in the range 1to 15 now apply lambda function and 
create a new list we should have sqaure roots of elements.


###Four pillars of OOPS:

1.obtraction-hidind the implementation part showing what is required for the user
             EG:"EXE FILE"
2.encapsulation-We can made class or method as obstract,opposite  to obstract is concrete. 
                binding data and function into a single entity.
                PUBLIC------one class info can be accessed by any other class
                PRIVATE-----can used where it is declared/no in inheritance class.
                PROTECTED---can be accessed only where it got declared----whichever class
                            inherited from this class there also we can use.
3.inheritance-base class and derived class
                  derived class will inherit properties of base class
              base class---parent class
              derived class---child class.
         types of inheritance: 
                    1.single inheritance
                    2.multiple inheritance
                    3.multi level inheritance
                    4.hierarchical inheritance
                    5.hybrid inheritance
4.polymorphism 

##polymorphism

one item or same item used for differenr purpose 

TYPES:
1.overloading 
 a.operator overloading 
 b.method overloading 
2.overriding-If s method is defective or cant be used inside derived class it will take it 
from its base class or parent class
