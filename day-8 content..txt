
##DATA STRUCTURE:

*HELPS to write efficient programs
*linear-array--linked list--stack--queue --matrix
*non linear-binary tree--heap--hash table--graph
*linear--storing data sequentially
*non linear--no sequencial style required 

 STATIC(fixed)-array
 DYNAMIC(not fixed)-list
                    stack
                  
##LINKED LIST:---as the name says list of items which are linked with one another.(EG:-train)

TYPES:
--->singly
--->doubly
--->circular

every node has 2 segments called data & address
-->1st node is head
-->last node is tail11:36 25-02-2023
-->head contains address
-->last segment is null

##CREATING LINKED LIST:
step-1:create the node 
step-2:partition the node with two segments--data and none 
step-3:add value into the blank node 
step-4:mark the node as head 
step-5:create the next node by following the above steps
step-6:establish link between first node and the second node

--displaying linked list--
traverse is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list
