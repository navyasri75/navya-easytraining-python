#PYTHON INTRODUCTION:
python is famous in the market and it is called as "LANGUAGE OF FUTURE".it supports current technologies & upcoming technologies.
->MEDIUM=IDLE(Integrated Development Learning Environment),JUPYTER NOTEBOOK,ANACONDA,DHONY

#RULES FOR CREATING VARIABLES IN PYTHON:
1.a variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2.a variable name cannot start with a number
3.a variable name can contain only alpha-numeric characters and underscore(A-Z,0-9,AND _)
4.variable names are case-sensitive(i.e..,name,Name,NAME are three diff variables)
5.the reserved words(keywords)cannot be used for naming the variable

#DATATYPES:
1.NUMERICAL DATATYPE:int,float,complex
2.BOOLEAN DATATYPE:True,False or 1,0
3.SEQUENCE DATATYPE:string,list,tuple,dictionary

#ISINSTANCE:

#TYPE CONVERSIONS:
converting one datatype to another datatype

#OPERATORS PRECIDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY LAW:
every operator has its own priority,we can use"BODMAS" rule
B-brackets-(),{},[]
O-of-square root,power,indices
D-division-%
M-multiplication-*
A-addition-+
S-subtraction->-
->if there is same priority operators present in the expression evaluation happens from left to right .except one operator "ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR"[R->L]

#PROGRAM:
take 3 int nos,3 float nos,2 string nos & 1 complex no as input,print same
note:use formatted output


#PROGRAMS:
1.kumar is buying 75 kgs candy and half of it he gives to his friend sam,sam returns to kumar half in what she got.now how much candy kumar is having
2.with 3 times of 36.32 you have to add 56.19 and subtract 10 from the total,print final result
3.multiply one +ve no with one -ve floating point no and find out the result

#UNICODE FOR TELUGU LETTERS:
print(chr(3128)+chr(3108)+chr(3149)+chr(3119))

#OPERATORS:
1.ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:+,-,,/,%,*,//
addition->X+Y
subtraction->X-Y
multiplication->X*Y
division->X/Y
modulus->X%Y
exponentiation->X**Y
floor division->X//Y
2.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:=,+=,-=,=,/=,%=,//=,*=,&=,|=,^=,>>=,<<=
X=5
X=X+3
X=X-3
X=X/3
X=X*3
X=X%3
X=X//3
X=X**3
X=X&3
X=X|3
X=X^3
X=X>>3->IN RIGHT SHIFT,if we shift a number by n times to right,the output will be number=|2**n(|2^n)
X=X<<3->IN LEFT SHIFT,if we shift a number by n times to left,the output will be number=2*n(*2^n)
3.COMPARISON OPERATORS:==,!=,>,<,<=,>=
1.EQUAL-X==Y
2.NOT EQUAL-X!=Y
3.LESS THAN-X<Y
4.GREATER THAN-X<Y
5.LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO-X<=Y
6.GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO-X>=Y
4.LOGICAL OPERATORS:
AND-x<5 and x<10
OR-x<5 or x<4
NOT-not(x<4 and x>10)
5.IDENTITY OPERATORS:
IS-x is y
ISNOT-x is not y
6.MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS:
IN-x in y
NOT IN-x not in y
7.BITWISE OPERATORS

#MULTIPLE INPUTS IN SINGLE LINE:
n1,n2=int(input("enter")),int(input("enter"))
print(n1)
print(n2)
s=n1+n2
print(s)
 output:
enter5
enter6
11

n1,n2=int(input("enter")),int(input("enter"))
print(n1,n2)
output:
enter5
enter6
5 6

#GIVE INPUTS SEPARATED BY COMMA:
SPLIT METHOD:
string split()-it is used to split a string into a list
a,b=input("enter").split(",")
print(a)
print(type(a))
print(a,b)
output:
enter5,6
5
<class 'str'>
5 6

a,b=input("enter").split()
print(int(a)+int(b))
enter5 4
9

#PROGRAMS:
1.swap two numbers using temp value
2.swap two numbers without using temp value
3.find are of rectangle after getting length and breadth of a rectangle[l*b]
4.find perimeter of rectangle[2(l+b)]
